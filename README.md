This Project aims to create an interactive web page using TVMAZE API documentation. The data is collected, cleaned, and transformed into the SQL database form and then interactive web page is made using Javascript and flask framework.

STEPS FOLLOWED:
1) Collect TV series data from TVMaze API using Python scripts.
2) Bring the data in the form of dataframe and push to postgresSQL using python scripts.
3) Using flask framework, fetch the data from postgresSQL database and create an API link for creating an app.
5) Extract the data from flask API using Javascript D3 library, jsonify it and create three different kinds of    Visualizations as follow:
  a) Create an HTML page with the movie series data that can be filtered from a drop down menu.
  b) Group by tv series data and create different graphs.
  c) Create a geographical TVSeries map using leaflet and mapbox.
